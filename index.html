        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the privacy policy for our Chrome extension, Lira's Shot. Your privacy is critically important to us. This document outlines how we collect, use, and protect any information you provide while using our extension. By using this extension, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy. We are committed to safeguarding your data and ensuring transparency in how we manage any personal or non-personal information.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Our Chrome extension captures and uploads screenshots of the current webpage you are viewing. These screenshots are stored in a specified Google Drive folder that you configure. No other data, such as personal information, browsing history, or any other identifiable information, is collected, stored, or transmitted by the extension. The only data handled by the extension are the screenshots themselves, and these are directly uploaded to the associated Google Drive folder. We do not access, store, or share any other information from your browsing activity</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The only information our extension processes is the screenshot of the webpage you are currently viewing. This screenshot is immediately uploaded to the Google Drive folder you have configured within the extension. The extension does not store or process the screenshot beyond this action. We do not use or share your screenshots with any third-party services. The uploaded screenshots are only available in your Google Drive account, and the extension does not retain any copy of the screenshots or other information after the upload process is complete.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our Chrome extension interacts with Google Drive, a third-party service provided by Google, to upload and store the screenshots taken from your current webpage. When you use the extension, the screenshots are transferred directly to your Google Drive account, and the handling of these screenshots is subject to Google's privacy policy. We encourage you to review Google's Privacy Policy to understand how your data is handled when using Google Drive. Our extension does not interact with any other third-party services or collect any additional data from these services.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your information seriously. The screenshots captured by the extension are transferred securely to your Google Drive account using encrypted connections provided by Google's services. We do not store or retain any copies of the screenshots after they are uploaded, and no personal data is collected or processed by the extension. However, the security of your Google Drive account is your responsibility. We recommend using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication to safeguard access to your stored data. Our extension is designed with security best practices to minimize risks, but we encourage you to manage the security settings of your Google Drive account appropriately.</p>
